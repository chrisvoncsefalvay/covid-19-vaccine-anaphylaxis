\section{Introduction}

Anaphylaxis describes a severe systemic allergic reaction to an antigen, resulting in large-scale mast cell degranulation and, consequently, histamine release.\cite{metcalfe2009mechanisms}
In clinical practice, it typically manifests as an acute onset of respiratory symptoms, bronchoconstriction, urticaria, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and reduced blood pressure.\cite{lee2011anaphylaxis}
Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines, while fortunately vanishingly rare, are well-documented in relation to a wide range of vaccines.\cite{su2019anaphylaxis,kelso1999anaphylaxis,kelso1993anaphylaxis,nagao2016highly}
The COVID-19 vaccines approved in the United States (BNT162b2/tozinameran, mRNA-1273/elasomeran and Ad26.COV2.S, known as the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines, respectively) are no exception in this regard.
Rare episodes of anaphylaxis have been documented in the context of the Moderna\cite{covid2021allergicmoderna} and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well.\cite{shimabukuro2021allergic}

Because of the severity and, absent rapid and appropriate medical intervention, life-threatening nature of anaphylactic reactions, severe allergic adverse events have been key drivers behind vaccine hesitancy.\cite{tulloch2021covid,marcec2021postvaccination,jacobson2015vaccine}
This paper presents a reporting case-control approach to the systematic evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine related anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events.
The analysis is based on reports made to VAERS, a passive reporting system maintained jointly by the CDC and the FDA.\cite{singleton1999overview,chen1994vaccine}
As a reporting study, it is necessarily limited by the inherent shortcomings of passive reporting, including underreporting, overreporting and differential reporting.
It does, however, enable us to make conclusions about the low relative risk of anaphylaxis from COVID-19 vaccines in comparison with other immunisations.

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Data sources}

Data on adverse events following immunisations was obtained from VAERS via \url{vaers.hhs.gov}, comprising 1,072,351 patient entries, in respect of 1,421,356 distinct vaccination events.
Once entries with missing age, gender or unknown vaccine type superclass (VAERS variable \texttt{VAX\_TYPE} of value \texttt{UNK}) were filtered, 1,255,169 distinct reports remained.
Data loading and management was carried out using Python 3.7.5 and \texttt{pandas} 1.3.0.\cite{mckinney2011pandas}

\subsection{Identifying cases}\label{subsec:identifying-cases}

Cases were identified through reported anaphylactic symptoms.
For the purposes of this study, a report was considered a case if one or more of the following MedDRA terms:

\subsection{Identifying exposure}


\subsection{Case-control matching}


\subsection{Statistical analysis}
